# Pool-Party
<<<<<<< HEAD
## Goal
My friends have a pool and want to be able to play music fairly loud without disturbing their friends, so I'm trying to build a system of speakers that run along their fences creating destructive interference along theborders of the fence to cancel out (or almost cancel out the sound waves) - March 8th 2022 



## Research
